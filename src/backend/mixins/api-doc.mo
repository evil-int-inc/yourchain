    "# YourChain Backend API

YourChain is a YouTube-like video platform on the Internet Computer, with
immutable object storage for large media. This document describes the public Candid API of the backend canister:
its purpose, authentication and authorization model, identity derivation, units
and encodings, lifecycle and polling rules, mutation retry safety, and the
non-obvious integration gotchas.

## Purpose

The backend stores users (channel profiles), immutable video references,
subscriptions, and per-user notifications. It exposes:

- Public channel profiles and a global, published-only video feed with backend
  cursor pagination.
- Immutable object-storage uploads for videos (up to 1 GB) and optional
  thumbnails (up to 20 MB in the frontend).
- Subscribe/unsubscribe and a subscription feed of published videos.
- Per-user notifications for new subscribers and new videos from subscribed
  channels.
- An OQL data layer (`schema` / `execute`) that makes the persisted data
  queryable by the Caffeine Data Intelligence agent and, per entity, by end
  users.

## Authentication and authorization

### Registration prerequisite

Access is gated by role-based access control. Before any role-guarded call
(guarded queries included), a signed-in caller must register by calling
`_initialize_access_control()` once. The **first** caller to register becomes
`#admin`; every subsequent caller becomes `#user`. Anonymous callers are
skipped and never registered. `_internet_identity_sign_in_finish()` also
registers the caller as part of the sign-in flow.

Roles are `#admin`, `#user`, and `#guest` (anonymous). A caller with `#admin`
passes every permission check; `#user` passes checks that require `#user`;
`#guest` (anonymous) fails checks that require `#user` or `#admin`.

### What an unregistered or anonymous caller receives

- **Anonymous caller** on a guarded endpoint that traps: the call traps with
  `Unauthorized: Only users can perform this action` (or
  `Unauthorized: Only admins can perform this action` for
  `registerStorageProvider`).
- **Anonymous caller** on a guarded endpoint that returns early instead of
  trapping: `getCallerProfile` returns `null`, `isSubscribed` returns `false`,
  `getSubscribedChannels` returns `[]`, `getUnreadNotificationCount` returns
  `0`, and `getSubscriptionFeed` returns an empty page.
- **Unregistered signed-in (non-anonymous) caller**: the permission check
  itself traps with `User is not registered`, because the role lookup cannot
  find the caller. This applies to every guarded endpoint, including the ones
  that return early for anonymous callers.

### Why a caller can be unregistered

Registration happens only when a caller signs in through the app's own
frontend (or calls `_initialize_access_control` directly). A principal that
never did so is unregistered even when it belongs to the app's owner. A
signed-in caller derived against a different origin is a different principal
than the one the frontend registered, and therefore appears unregistered.

### Identity derivation

The frontend pins an Internet Identity derivation origin, published at
`/.well-known/ii-derivation-origin` when available. An agent already holding
the user's Internet Identity authorization derives the correct per-app
principal against that origin, for example:

    icp identity link web <name> --app <host>

Such a delegation acts with the user's full authority in this app until it
expires.

## Units and encodings

- **Timestamps** are nanoseconds since the Unix epoch (`Time.now()`), typed as
  `Int`. `createdAt` and `publishedAt` use this encoding.
- **`UserId`** is a `Principal` (the caller's principal).
- **`Cursor`** is a `Nat`. `0` means \"first page\"; otherwise it is the id of
  the last item already returned (see Lifecycle and polling).
- **`Page<T>`** is `{ items : [T]; nextCursor : ?Nat }`.
- **`VideoStatus`**: `#draft`, `#processing`, `#published`, `#deleted`.
- **`NotificationKind`**: `#newSubscriber { channelId }` or
  `#newVideo { channelId; videoId }`.
- **`UserRole`**: `#admin`, `#user`, `#guest`.
- **Optional fields**: `bio` and `description` are `?Text`; `avatar` and
  `thumbnail` are `?ExternalBlob`; `publishedAt` is `?Int`. `null` means absent.
- **`video` / `thumbnail` / `avatar`** are immutable object-storage references. Generated
  frontend bindings expose them as `ExternalBlob`; use `getDirectURL()` for
  browser playback or image display.

## Lifecycle and polling

### Upload pipeline

The frontend creates `ExternalBlob` values from the selected files. Generated
bindings upload their bytes to the storage gateway in one-megabyte chunks,
then call `createVideo` with immutable references and metadata. `createVideo`
validates the declared video metadata and creates a `#draft` record.
`publishVideo(videoId)` sets the record to `#published` and records
`publishedAt`. Subscribers are notified only for public videos.

Global and subscription feeds return only public `#published` videos.
Channel pages also return only public videos, except that the channel owner
can see their own private published videos. `getVideo` returns a private video
only to its owner, so privacy is enforced before media references reach the
frontend.

`recordVideoView(videoId)` increments the durable view counter after playback
starts. It accepts published public videos and private videos viewed by their
owner, and returns the updated count.

### Pagination

All paginated endpoints (`getFeed`, `getSubscriptionFeed`, `getChannelVideos`,
`getMyVideos`, `getNotifications`) return newest-first by descending id. Pass
`cursor = 0` for the first page, then pass the returned `nextCursor` as the
next `cursor`. Stop polling when `nextCursor` is `null`. A `limit` of `0`
returns an empty page with `nextCursor = null`.

## Mutation retry safety

- Storage-gateway chunk retries are managed by the object-storage client before
  the canister mutation is sent.
- **`subscribe` / `unsubscribe`** are idempotent: subscribing twice to the same
  channel is a no-op (a set add), and unsubscribing from a channel you do not
  follow is a no-op. `subscribe` traps `Cannot subscribe to yourself` when
  `channelId == caller`.
- **`publishVideo` / `deleteVideo`** are idempotent status transitions: they
  overwrite the video's status. `publishVideo` re-notifies subscribers on every
  call, so call it once.
- **`markNotificationsRead`** is idempotent.
- **`saveProfile`** upserts the caller's profile. It traps `Username already
  taken` if the requested `username` is held by another user. Supplying an
  avatar replaces it; otherwise `removeAvatar = true` removes the current one
  and `false` preserves it.
- **`recordVideoView` is not idempotent.** Call it only for the first playback
  event in a watch-page visit.

## Errors, traps, and limits

- **Traps** (opaque rejects, not `Result` errors): `Unauthorized: Only users
  can perform this action`, `Unauthorized: Only admins can perform this
  action`, `Unauthorized: Not the video owner`, `User is not registered`,
  `Cannot subscribe to yourself`, `Username already taken`, `Video not found`,
  `Video not available`,
  and validation messages for invalid title, filename, MIME type, description,
  or file size.
- **Size limits**: videos are limited to 1 GB by both the frontend and
  `createVideo`; thumbnails are limited to 20 MB and avatars to 5 MB by the
  frontend.
- **Ownership**: `publishVideo` and `deleteVideo` require the caller to own the
  video. Private reads expose the record only to that same owner.

## Non-obvious integration gotchas

- A caller must register (via `_initialize_access_control` or the frontend
  sign-in) before any guarded call; an unregistered signed-in caller traps with
  `User is not registered` rather than receiving a graceful denial.
- `deleteVideo` is a soft delete: the video row remains in storage with status
  `#deleted` and is simply excluded from feeds and `getVideo` for non-owners.
- `getVideo` returns `null` for a private or non-published video unless the
  caller is its owner.
- OQL `schema()` and `execute()` honour per-entity authorization: public
  users are readable by anyone, while videos, upload sessions, subscriptions,
  and notifications are scoped so each signed-in caller reads only owned rows.
